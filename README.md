## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Media queries for responsiveness
- CSS transitions for smooth animations

### What I learned

- How to use semantic HTML for better accessibility and SEO.
- How to create a responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries.
- How to use CSS transitions to animate changes in padding, border-radius, and box-shadow for a smoother user experience.
- How to structure image paths and assets for deployment on GitHub Pages.

```css
.main-wrapper {
  transition: padding 0.6s cubic-bezier(0.4,0,0.2,1);
}
```

### Continued development

- Improve accessibility by adding ARIA labels and roles.
- Explore CSS Grid for more complex layouts.
- Add dark mode support.
